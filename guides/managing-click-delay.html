<h4><a id="Problem_2"></a>Problem</h4>

<p>When beginning mobile development, you may notice that your app feels a bit sluggish when you tap on the screen. This
    is because the mobile web browser is trying to interpret touch commands to map them to old-style <em>click</em>
    events. The browser receives a <em>touchstart</em> event first, then it listens to see if the finger is going to
    move to scroll or release to become a tap before it fires the click event your app is listening for. These same
    browser engines also have a <em>double-tap-to-zoom</em> function so then thereb's the issue of distinguishing
    between a <em>tap</em> and <em>double tap</em>.</p>

<p>The total lag introduced by the browser trying to interpret the <em>touch</em> event to <em>click</em> event mapping
    is about 300ms. 300ms may not sound like a lot but itb's more than enough to make an app feel noticeable lag.</p>

<h4><a id="Solution_8"></a>Solution</h4>

<p>Use a <strong>touch-to-click</strong> polyfill like <a href="https://ftlabs.github.io/fastclick/
">FastClick</a>. FastClick is a library you can
    implement to take the incoming touch events and maps them to the click event without the 300ms delay. An example of
    one way to use it is shown below, see their documentation for more details.</p>
<pre><code>window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    FastClick.attach(document.body);
    }, false);
</code></pre>
<p>Use a UI framework with built-in handling for this issue, such as <a
        href="http://ionicframework.com">Ionic</a>, <a
        href="http://www.idangero.us/framework7/">Framework7</a> and <a href="http://onsenui.io">OnsenUI</a>.</p>
